  # we need the push event to make it show up nicely in the UI
  # this however brings a whole new slew of problems, like how do we identify the
  # incoming PR's artifacts?
  # well, we set a tag on that PR's artifact, in the form of
  # pr-{head_of_pr}-{pr_head_of_main}
  # when with git rev-parse HEAD^2 we can find the incoming PR's head
